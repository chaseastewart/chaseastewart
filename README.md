- 👋 Hi, I’m @chaseastewart
- I'm a software engineer with over eleven years of experience working with Healthcare data and Interoperability standards.
- While at Oracle Cerner, I had the pleasure of developing Millennium Interoperability products including the Open Engine interface engine.
- Here you can find projects I've been working on recently. My goal is to open source a couple projects each year.
- You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chase-a-stewart/). I'm always happy to connect with new people.
